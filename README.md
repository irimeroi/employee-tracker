package.json: npm init -y
iniquirer: npm i inquirer@8.2.4

## [Usage] (#table-of-contents)
This project needs to be run by the command line, which can be accessed by opening the JavaScript file in the integrated terminal, and start it by typing either 'npm run' or 'node index'. The user will be prompted with a series of questions, where they will be able to choose among viewing, adding, updating, or deleting departments, roles or employees, or more complex options like viewing employees and budget by department, or viewing each employee's manager.

## [Credits] (#table-of-contents)
I was able to create this code thanks to the help of the TA, tutors and old codes that were given to us as learning tools.
